  ┌──────────────┬──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┐

Lists problems that could not be auto-fixed and require manual review:

```
⚠️ Remaining Issues (5)

## What Happens to Your Document?

### Automatic Fixes Applied

When issues are detected and `AutoFix = Yes`:

1. **Original document is backed up**
   - SharePoint versioning preserves history
   - You can always restore previous versions

2. **Fixes are applied**
   - Text corrections (spelling, grammar)
   - Font standardisation
   - Symbol replacements

3. **Document is saved**
   - Overwrites the original file
   - Version history maintained

### Manual Review Needed

When `AutoFix = No` or issues can't be corrected:

1. **Document is not modified**
   - Original remains untouched

2. **Issues are reported**
   - Listed in HTML report
   - Status shows "Failed"

3. **You must fix manually**
   - Open document in Word
   - Review HTML report for specific issues
   - Make corrections
   - Save to re-trigger validation

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Document Passes Validation

✅ **What happened:**
- All issues auto-fixed
- Document meets style guide
- Ready for distribution

**Next steps:**
- No action needed
- Review HTML report to see what was fixed (optional)
- Download/share the document

---

### Scenario 2: Document Fails Validation

❌ **What happened:**
- Some issues couldn't be fixed automatically
- Manual review required

**Next steps:**
1. Open the HTML report
2. Review "Issues Detected" section
3. Open document in Word
4. Make manual corrections
5. Save → validation re-runs automatically

**Common manual fixes:**
- Date format corrections (must be "DD MONTH YYYY")
- Numbers below 10 spelled out in text
- Context-dependent grammar (licence vs. license)

---

### Scenario 3: Validation Takes Too Long

⏳ **If stuck on "Validating..." for >2 minutes:**

1. **Check file size**
   - Large documents (>50 pages) take longer
   - Consider splitting very large files

2. **Refresh the page**
   - Press F5 or click refresh
   - Status should update

3. **Check for errors**
   - Admin: Review Azure Function logs
   - Look for API timeouts or errors

---

### Scenario 4: Unwanted Changes Made

↩️ **To restore previous version:**

1. Click **...** (three dots) next to document
2. Select **Version History**
3. Find the version before validation
4. Click **...** → **Restore**

**Note:** Validation creates a new version each time it modifies the document.
